# Summoning Simulator
 A code made by me to simulate summoning food souls for the game Food Fantasy.
 **Please note that the code is a simulator and will not affect in-game data.**
### Computer
 If you already have Python 3.5.2 installed on your computer, skip step 1 and 2.
 * Step 1: Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/ and download Python 3.5.2.
 * Step 2: Follow the steps and install Python in your computer.
 * Step 3: Download my Python code by pressing "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP"; everything will be downloaded.
 * Step 4: After unzipping the file, you can double click it to run the code.
 * Step 5: Have fun!
### Mobile
 * Step 1: Search "QPython" on your Google Play Store or App Store and download it (or click the link here).
   * Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qpython.qpy&hl=en_SG
   * App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qpython/id1262366391?mt=8
 * Step 2: Once you installed the app, allow photos, media etc.
 * Step 3: Go to "More" and press "Switch to Python 3".
 * Step 4: You'll be redirected to the App Store/Google Play Store. Download "QPy3.6".
 * Step 5: Launch the app and allow photos, media, etc. Then press "START QPYTHON", you'll be directed back to the original QPython app
 * Step 6: Now you should be able to use Python 3 (using Python 2 has many issues)
 * Step 7: Come back to this website and switch to Desktop mode.
 * Step 8: Download my Python code by pressing "Clone or download", then "Download ZIP"; everything will be downloaded.
 * Step 9: After unzipping the file, go to the app and press "Explore".
 * Step 10: Find the file name in "Download" called "summonsim-master". You should find the code there.
 * Step 11: Upon pressing the code file, you'll be able to see the code. On the bottom of the screen, press the "Play" button (the triangle shaped button)
 * Step 12: The code should be able to run. Have fun and enjoy!
